🧠 How the AI Works

The AI adapts to user taste using:

* Genre preference weights
* Language preference weights
* Director preference tracking
* User explicit feedback (like/dislike)
* Watched movie history

Scoring Factors:

* TMDB Rating
* Popularity
* Genre Overlap
* Language Match
* Vote Count Confidence
* Source Type (similar, keyword, collection)
* Small randomness factor for diversity

🔍 Recommendation Strategies

The system combines multiple discovery strategies:

1. **Keyword-Based Thematic Search**
2. **Similar Movies (TMDB endpoint)**
3. **Recommended Movies (TMDB endpoint)**
4. **Genre-Based Discovery**
5. **Collection/Franchise Matching**

This hybrid approach improves diversity and relevance.
